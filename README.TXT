This is the result (the fifth step) of a whole month of work for my last assignment in this java course. 
I learnt a lot and although the interface is not the most stylish one, 
as the assignment did not require high css skills but a solid coding for the program, 
it works perfectly as required, it was tested and rated and gave me the final Certificate for my 5 month course in Java.
